The goal of the following exercises is to learn how to access and play with the trigger objects in our data and compute the efficiency of a specific HLT path, having a look also at its Level 1 (L1) seed. The focus will be on a HLT path used during the 2016 data-taking to select events with a certain amount of missing transverse energy: `HLT_PFMET170_HBHECleaned_v*`.
