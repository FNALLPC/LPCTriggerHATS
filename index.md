### Goal of this exercise

This exercise will introduce you to the CMS trigger system and, in particular, trigger efficiency measurements. After this exercise (including the introductory lecture):

 * You will be familiar with basic concepts and terminology related to triggering, so that you can apply them in your work (e.g. turn-on, prescale, matching...)
 * You will be able to describe the main features of the CMS trigger system
 * You will have an overview of the CMS trigger menu, allowing you to identify suitable triggers for your physics analysis
 * You will be familiar with the analysis tools needed to access trigger-related information in CMS datasets
 * You will know how to perform trigger efficiency measurements
